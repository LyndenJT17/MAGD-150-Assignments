In my first lab is very basic.  The code constructs a tall house made out of basic shapes.  You can view it by clicking [here](https://github.com/LyndenJT17/MAGD-150-Assignments/blob/gh-pages/s20magd150lab01_Lynden_2020_04_24_18_41_30.zip)

The seond lab is supposed to appear as a mini solar system.  There are multiple different shapes with different colors.

My third lab creates two ellipes.  One ellipse follow to mouse everywhere it goes.  The second ellipse will follow the mouse on a vertical axis.  Click [here](https://github.com/LyndenJT17/MAGD-150-Assignments/blob/gh-pages/s20magd150lab03_Lynden_2020_04_24_18_42_00.zip)

My fifth lab creates a tv and a remote control.  The remote control has two text labeled buttons.  One changes the screen to a random color and the other button makes the triangle move left and right when clicked.

My seventh lab creates trees.  It allows you to create multiple trees of the same shape and size without having to write a paragraph of code.  [view by clicking here](https://github.com/LyndenJT17/MAGD-150-Assignments/blob/gh-pages/s20magd150lab07_Lynden_2020_04_24_18_45_31.zip)
